# AdoptOpenJDK Performance Testing

We are in the process of adding more microbenchmarks (both bumblebench and jmh formats) and full open-source benchmarks to this directory. New perftest jobs are added to the [Test_perf](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/Test_perf/) view.  While we will run these benchmarks regularly at AdoptOpenJDK, the intention is to make it easy for developers to run performance testing locally.  

You can follow the [same manual testing instructions](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/master/doc/userGuide.md#local-testing-via-make-targets-on-the-commandline) to run these tests, as you do for all of the other tests we run.  The top-level make target for tests contained in this directory (openjdk-tests/performance) is "perf".  So, once you compile test material, running "make perf" will run all of the testcases defined in playlist.xml files in this directory and its subdirectories.  Each unique benchmark is housed in a 
subdirectory and given a meaningful name.  Once the reorganization of this directory is complete, the directory structure will look like:

```
//./
//├── micro
//├────── idle
//├────── bumblebench
//├────── jmh
//├── odm
//├── acme_air
//├── liberty_daytrader
```
Each subdirectory requires a build.xml file describing where to pull the benchmark suite from, and how to build and run it.  Each subdirectory also requires a playlist.xml file which describes what commands to run in order to execute a particular benchmark run.
### Microbenchmarks
#### idle_micro
Currently we run a single micro-benchmark called idle_micro against OpenJDK8 builds (both hotspot and openj9 variants).  

#### bumblebench  
In plan, we intend to add other microbenchmarks found in the [bumblebench repo](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/bumblebench).  There are already a good variety of microbenchmarks for evaluating performance of various aspects of code, such as string, lambda, gpu, math, crypto, etc.

### Full Benchmark Suites
Transparency and the ability to see how the binaries are being exercised is important to us.  We will focus on running fully open-sourced benchmarks at AdoptOpenJDK so that developers have full-access to see the benchmarking code.  

#### odm 
Added, but not running regularly in builds, as some of the test materials are not yet available in the open.  

#### acme_air 
In plan, benchmark material to be cloned from the [acme-air git repo](https://github.com/blueperf/acmeair-monolithic-java).

#### liberty_daytrader
In plan
